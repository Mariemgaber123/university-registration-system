University Registration System (Java)
Overview
A console-based University Registration System developed in Java. The system manages students, courses, and enrollments using custom data structures.

This project was built as a university project to demonstrate strong understanding of Data Structures, Object-Oriented Programming, and algorithmic thinking.

Features
Add and remove students
Add and remove courses
Enroll students in courses
Remove student enrollments
Display:
Courses registered by a student
Students registered in a course
Check if a student is a normal student
Check course capacity status
Undo and Redo enrollment actions
Sorting students and courses using Merge Sort
Technologies & Concepts
Java
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Linked Lists
Sparse Table representation
Stack-based Undo / Redo
Merge Sort algorithm
Project Structure
